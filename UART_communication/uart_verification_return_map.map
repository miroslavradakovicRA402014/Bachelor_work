    Number used as logic:                      356 out of  27,288    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             265
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                   91
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   135 out of   6,822    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        12 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          375
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           101 out of     375   26%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  19 out of     375    5%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         255 out of     375   68%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              72 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
